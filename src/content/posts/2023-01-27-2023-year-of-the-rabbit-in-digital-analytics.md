Google announced that Google Optimize will be ending on September 30, 2023. No further details have been provided so far, although Google has stated that it will integrate A/B testing capabilities into Google Analytics 4. 
The sun setting of Google Optimize has lead to a surge in competition among vendors, as they [ramp up their offerings](https://vwo.com/blog/launching-a-free-plan-of-vwo-testing-a-better-google-optimize/) to capture a void of the A/B testing market.

Don't let this sun setting of Google Optimize be one of the excuse not to test.
