This months session topic is “how to help you build a successful brand campaign on YouTube”



According to the speaker, Elaine Doyle

- 89% of traffic by 2022 will be video traffic. 
- Optimise video for those hot summer days with limited battery on mobile. 
- Critical to learn about what your customers care about so you can create videos they want to watch.
- YouTube viewers want 3 things: Information — Connection — Entertainment.
- YouTube has 50% higher ad watch time than any other platform and is the second largest search engine in the world. 
- Irish people spend 45 minutes a day watching YouTube on mobile alone. For 18–24yr olds, that’s more time than on Netflix and TV players, combined. 
- 6 second bite-size ads are extremely effective to engage. 16–20 second “snack ads” are excellent to flesh out your story and finally another bite-size to echo your message.
